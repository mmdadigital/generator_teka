# yo teka #

Repo for the amazing Teka Drupal theme's yeoman generator.

### How to get started? ###

First, install Teka generator's package globally:
```
#!javascript
sudo npm i -g generator-teka
```

Then you go to your project's theme directory:
```
#!javascript
cd /www/yourProject/sites/all/themes/
```

Run our Yeoman generator and answer the questions.
And after install, enter in your theme directory:
```
#!javascript
yo teka
cd theNameYouChose/
```

Install theme dependencies.
```
#!javascript
sudo npm i --unsafe-perm
```

If you chose to use Pattern Lab, just hit enter when asked about merging or
replace contents and about installing a starterkit.

Enable and set your theme as default.

### Gulp ###

Teka uses Gulp Build System to automate tasks.
Compile assets and watch file changes:
```
#!javascript
gulp
```

### Pattern Lab integration (optional) ###
Install Component Libraries module:
```
drush dl components
drush en components -y
```

Edit pattern-lab/config/config.yml and change twigAutoescape to false.
```
twigAutoescape: false
```

Pattern Lab front-end will be generated by Gulp, see "Gulp" topic.
